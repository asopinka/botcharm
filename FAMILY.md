## Add Your Bot

To add your bot to the BotCharm family, just follow these steps!

1. Fork the repo and create a branch from `master` with the name of the bot you want to add.
2. Edit `docs/_config.yml` and add a new item to the ***bottom*** of the bots section. It should look something like this:
```
bots:
	- name: "Obie.ai"
	  link: "https://obie.ai"
	  icon: "https://obie.ai/img/obie-dyecut.png"
	...
	(Other bots in between)
	...
	- name: "Your bot's name"
	  link: "Your bot's homepage"
	  icon: "URL to a SQUARE icon/logo for your bot"
```
3. Commit, push, and create a pull request!

We'll get it the pull request merged asap.
